# Super Mario Bros AI agent

Our project focuses on training an AI agent to play the popular game Super Mario Bros using reinforcement learning techniques. 
To accomplish this, we utilized the gym open-ai platform, which provides a standardized environment for testing and evaluating machine learning algorithms.

One of the key components of our approach is the use of Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm, to train the agent. 
Additionally, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the game screen, allowing the agent to learn directly from the raw pixels of the game.
